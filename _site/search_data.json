    "find-points-panel": {
      "title": "Find Points",
      "content"	 : "New in October, 2015.This documentation needs some work.The find points panel allows you to browse objects between two timepoints/sessions, will show you the best-guess for putative connections, and allow you to connect/disconnect objects across timepoints/sessions.To open the find points panel:  Right-click a spine in a map and selecting ‘Find Points’.  Right-click a session in the main Map Manager Panel and selecting ‘Find Points’.  Right-click a map in the main Map Manager Panel and selecting ‘Find Points’.Overview  The find points panel displays a list of all spines in the source timepoint (sIdx). In this example there are 21 spines in the source timepoint.  For each spines in the source timepoint, it shows if it is connected to the destination timepoint (dIdx). It will color the dIdx cell red if there is no connection.  Any remaining spines in the destination timepoint (spines not connected to the source timepoint) will be displayed at the bottom of the list. In this example there are 3 of these spines.  Each spine in the source timepoint will also have a best ‘Guess’ connection in the ‘Guess’ column. For spines, this is using your ‘Segment Pivot’ for the two segments listed in Find Points and will connect spines across timepoints/sessions that are within ‘Connect spines within this distance (um)’. See the Map Manager Options Panel to set this.Interface  From TP. Source timepoint/session (From TP)  To. Destination timepoint/session (To timepoint)  Object Type. Select the type of objects to display.  ShowBad. If checked, bad points will be included in the list. Bad points will always have their ‘Idx’ column in red.  Segment ID. Limit the list to one segment ID.  All Segments. Generate the list for all segments. If you are connecting spines, leave this off (unchecked).  Refresh. Will refresh the Find Points list. [as of Nov 2015, there may be some edits to the map that do not refresh the list automatically.]Column NamesClicking on any column name will sort the list by the values in that column. Column names starting with ‘s’ are for the source timepoint (from TP), column names starting with ‘d’ are for the destination timepoint (to TP).  Idx - The row index in the table (no relation to object index).  sIdx - Source object stack db index.  sz - Source object z-depth  sParent - Source object parent segment.  spDist - Source object distance from pivot.  Guess - Automatically generated best guess for connection. This uses each objects distance from pivot (spDist and dpDist) and returns objects within X um, where X is specified by ‘Connect spines within this distance (um)’.  dIdx - Destination object stack db index.  dz - Destination object z-depth  dpDist - Destination object distance from pivot.  Dist - When two points are connected (both sIdx and dIdx are filled in), this is the distance between the two points measured as the distance between their two pivot points (spDist and dpDist).Interaction  Bring up a map run by right-clicking a row and selecting ‘Plot Run’.  Select an object in the list and it will be propagated to all run and map plots.  Use the keyboard to scroll through the list. The selected point will flash in all open windows.  Use left/right arrows to flash the selected object again.Using the keyboard to connect and disconnect objectsFor a selected row  ‘shift + right-arrow’ to commit the ‘Guess’ to the destination (dIdx). This will connect the source and destination objects together, making them persistent.  ‘del’ key to remove the connection. This will remove persistence between the source and destination objects.  ‘ctrl + p’ to set the selected point at the global pivot. This is not used for spines.TipsWhen used with a spine run, find points is a reliable way to check the connections between all objects in two timepoints.All objects in the source timepoint are in the list, followed by any remaining objects in destination timepoint that were not connected to an object in the source timepoints.By sorting the list with the source distance from pivot (spDist), you can step through all spines in the source timepoint sequentially along the dendritic segment.By sorting the list with the destination distance from pivot (dpDist), you get a sequential list of all objects in the destination timepoint.Example usage of find points panel. Here, we have a run of sessions 1/2/3 (top row). We have positioned the Find Points panel below the stack for session 2. By selecting rows (spines) in Find Points we can browse all spines in session 2, visualize their connections to session 3, and finally edit their connections to session 3 (using the keyboard in Find Points Panel).",

You need to purchase an Igor Pro license from Wavemetrics, download Igor Pro and install it.  To try out Igor Pro, download and install a fully functional but time limited demo version.Installing Map Manager  Once Igor Pro is installed, there is no formal installation of Map Manager  Get the source code from Bob.  The source code will be in a folder named ‘MapManager_date’ where ‘date’ is the date the software was created. The folder will be something like ‘MapManager_20151117’.  Run the software by double-clicking MapManager.ipf from within the source code folder.  To fit lines in FIJI you will have to specify a hard-drive path to FIJI and install a plugin in FIJI. Please see fitting segments in fiji.Opening/Running Map Manager  Open MapManager.ipf into Igor Pro (just double click the MapManager.ipf file).  Once in Igor Pro, click in the command window to compile Map Manager and activate the main menus. The command window is in the lower left of your screen and has the window title ‘Untitled’.  To score a single timepoint stack, select the main menu ‘MapManager - Stack Browser’ to open the Stack Browser panel. See Simple Stack DB for more information.  To score a timeseries of stacks (a map), select the main menu ‘MapManager - Map Manager Panel’ to open the main Map Manager panel. See Making A Map for more information.Closing/Quiting Map Manager  Quit Igor Pro by selecting the main menu ‘Igor Pro - Quit Igor Pro’.  When you quit Igor Pro, you will always be prompted with the following dialog.  Always answer No. All Map Manager analysis is saved using the ‘Save’ buttons from within the Map Manager interface.Map Manager Options  Global options are set in the Options Panel.  There is one set of options that will be reloaded the next time Map Manager is run.  Save the current options with the ‘Save’ button in the Options panel.

      "content"	 : "LimitationsImporting      Map Manager is designed to import single color channel 3D .tif files. For other file types (e.g. .lsm) or for other cases like 2 color channel .tif files we have some FIJI plugins that should get you started.        To import 2 color channel .tif files, the files need to be split into 2 separate .tif files (with _ch1 and _ch2 in their names). See bAlignBatch, a FIJI plugin that does this for you.        Does not handle .tif stacks with multiple repeats per images plane. Map Manager will import these stacks fine but does not know about the repeats. You want to strip out repeats before importing into Map Manager.  File name rules  Map Manager will have problems if any of the following strings are in your source file names:  _ch1  _ch2  _zsVisualization  Will only display one channel at a time. For most purposes this is fine. You can quickly switch between the color channels and run intensity analysis on both channels independently. To visualize a merged or composite image, use FIJI.",

      "content"	 : "Algorithm and StrategyAll intensity analysis is performed by calculating statistics (Sum, Mean, standard-deviation, N) from the intensity values of pixels within a number of 3D regions-of-interest (ROI). Further analysis is then derived by performing algebra between these ROIs.Spine ROIA polygon surrounding a spine. Starts as a rectangle and then overlapping regions of the backbone/dendrite ROI is subtracted. Any remaining disjoint regions (on other side of backbone/dendrite) are then removed. The spine ROI is centered in the same image plane as the spine head. Three parameters specify spine ROI: width, extend head, and extend tail.Backbone/Dendrite ROIA polygon centered on the spine connection point and extending a fixed distance (um) up and down the backbone/dendrite line. The backbone/dendrite ROI is centered in the same image plane as the spine connection point. The distance to extend up and down the backbone/dendrite line is set with ‘+/- Segment (um)’Background ROIBoth the spine roi and the backbone/dendrite roi get their own background ROIs. The spine background ROI is the same size/shape as the spine ROI. Likewise, the backbone/dendrite background ROI is the same size/shape as the backbone/dendrite ROI. The position of these background ROIs is the position that gives the minimal intensity from a number of candidate positions (a 3x3 grid emanating from the spine head). All background ROIs (both spine and backbone/dendrite) are centered in the same image plane as the spine head.Please note, parameters controlling the grid of candidate background positions is not exposed to the user.Running Intensity AnalysisIntensity analysis is run from the main map manager panel using the ‘Intensity’ tab.ParametersGlobal intensity analysis parameters are set in the stack db options panel. These parameters are used for every spine in a map.Once intensity analysis has been run, the parameters of individual spines can be set using the ‘Object Info’ panel in a stack. Open the Object Info window in a stack with keyboard ‘i’.  Width (um). Width of spine ROI centered on the spine line.  Extend head (um). Distance to extend the spine ROI beyond its spine head.  Extend tail (um). Distance to extend the spine ROI beyond it connection point with the backbone/dendrite..  +/- Slices. The statistics (Sum, Mean, SD, N) of each spine, backbone, and background ROI is calculated after expanding the ROI up and down in Z-dimension.      +/- Segment (um). The distance (um) to extend the backbone/dendrite ROI up and down the backbone/dendrite line.    Background - Both Sides. Only available as a global options.  Background Rows. Only available as a global options.  Background Row Mult. Only available as a global options.  Background Columns. Only available as a global options.      Background Column Mult. Only available as a global options.    Scale Radius (um). Only available for individual spines using the Object Info Panel. When intensity analysis is run (for a map), each spine is assigned a radius (um) following the radius of the segment it is attached to. Once intensity analysis has been run, this radius can be set for individual spines in the Object Info panel.Intensity Analysis OutputThe following statistics are calculated and displayed in the X/Y statistics lists in the Plot Panel.A table of these statistics can be displayed for each stack in the stack db panel. To do this: (1) in a stack window, open the stack db panel with keyboard ‘[’, (2) click on the point list and (3) use keyboard ‘i’ for intensity.Please note, ‘u’ is for user.

This is most easily done using the Hard Drive Paths panel. Here are the details:  Run Map Manager with the MapManager.ipf file (this is how you always run Map Manager).  Open the HDD Paths panel using the main menu ‘MapManager - Hard Drive Paths’.  In the Map Manager HD Paths panel, specify the path to your Fiji Application with the corresponding ‘Set’ button.  In the main Options Panel,save the global options with the ‘Save’ button. The next time Map Manager is run, it will remember and use this Fiji path.If that does not work, you can specify the location of your Fiji program in a Map Manager User File. The user file needs to contain a line like this…# Specify the location of your Fiji executable.# Please use &#39;Fiji Life-Line version, 2013 July 15&#39;.# macroot:stackdb2:options:gFijiPath=&quot;/Users/cudmore/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/Imagej-macosx&quot;# windows# root:stackdb2:options:gFijiPath=&quot;C:Userscudmore.linden-image2DesktopFiji.appfiji-win64.exe&quot;Make sure the actual Fiji executable exists. Don’t assume the name of Fiji is ‘fiji-win64.exe’, this name changes from version to version of Fiji. If there is an error in this path, there WILL be an error when fitting lines in Map Manager.TroubleshootingIf line fits do not work from within Map Manager, please check the following  You are using the ‘Fiji Life-Line version, 2013 July 15’.  Your Fiji.app folder can not be in a folder with any spaces or special characters in its path (this includes ‘Program Files’).  You have downloaded and install the ‘Bob_Neurite_Tracer_v3.java’  You have specified your Fiji path within Map Manager using ‘MapManager - Hard Drive Paths’.",

      "content"	 : "A run plot is a sequence of stack plots, one for each session in a map. The image above shows a run plot of spines. Spine # 201 is selected in each of three stack plots.There are three types of run plots:  Stack Run. In its simplest form, a run plot showing the sequence of stacks in a map.  Segment Run. The same as a stack run plot but connected segments are selected, displayed, and optionally zoomed.  Object Run. The same as a stack run plot but individual stack db points (3D points) are followed across sessions in a map. One example is a run of spine objects across all stacks/sessions in a map.Opening a run plotA run plot can be opened from multiple places in the interface. In general, a right-click on a session or object will open a contextual popup-menu (shown on the left).  Right-click an object in a map plot.  Right-click an object in a search results.  Right-click a session in the expanded main map maker panelNavigating a run plotEach stack plot plot in a run plot behaves exactly like an individual stack plot. For example, left-click to select individual objects in any of the stack-db plots within a run plot.There are additional interface elements available in a run plot.      Control+click on an object in one stack plot of a run plot will select that object in all other stack plots of the run plot. If a stack plot at a given session is missing the object (for example, the object was subtracted), the image will snap to the region where the point ‘would be’.        Keyboard-l (that is lower-case ‘l’ as in ‘link’) will link all stacks in a run plot allowing them to be zoomed and panned in synch. Linking can be turned on and off again by pressing keyboard-l.        keyboard a/s/p/b, see below  Editing dynamics in a run plotThe dynamics between stack-db objects and segments can be edited in a run plot.  a : The selected object is marked as Addition.  s : The selected object is marked as Subtraction  p : The selected objects are marked as Persistent. Requires a selection in two timepoints, see below.  b : The selected object is marked as Bad. This is only available for stack-db objects, it is not available for segments.Persistent is a special caseWhen two objects are connected between two sequential timepoints/sessions we refer to them as ‘persistent’. To connect two points and make them persistent, both points need to be selected (in their respective timepoints) and the point in the latter timepoint needs to be marked persistent.  Click in the source stack window and select an object. For example, timepoint 2.  Click in the destination stack window and select an object. For example, timepoint 3.  Press keyboard ‘p’ in the destination stack window. In this example, timepoint 3.Important: The keyboard commands above will default to editing the dynamics of stack-db objects. To edit the dynamics between segments, turn on the global option in the main Map Manager panel by checking ‘Edit Segments’.All of these keyboard commands have corresponding right-click contextual menus. Select a point and right-click to open the contextual menu.Using stack db object tags in a run plotTurn on object tags for a given stack window using keyboard ‘t’. The dynamics of each object is encoded in the color of the tag, green for addition, red for subtraction, and yellow for persistent. Objects that are in the same run will have the same number in each of the stack plots. Added objects get a new number. This system is designed to quickly visualize the connectivity between stack db objects.Example run plot following a spine (yellow circle) through multiple timepoints in a map.Same run plot as above after zooming in. All stacks in a run plot can be synchronized with keyboard ‘l’ (as in Link) so that zooming, panning, and setting the slice in one stack plot of a run will propagate to all other stack plots of that run.A segment run plot with the same segment selected in all timepoints. Note the difference in scale compared to the spine run examples. All scale bars are 5 um.",

      "title": "Making a map",
      "content"	 : "A map is a sequence of stacks. You create a map by appending stacks from the stack browser. Once a map is made it can be opened, saved, annotated, and browsed using the main map maker panel.The main Map Manager panel shows a list of open maps on the left. When a map is selected (a5n in this example), a list of sessions in the map are shown on the right (in this example there are 4 sessions).Open and initialize Map Manager  Open Igor Pro with MapManager.ipf  Initialize Map Manager with the main menu ‘MapManager - Map Manager Panel’.1. Pre-process your raw data so Map Manager can import itMap Manager will only import single channel stacks. If your stacks have two color channels, they need to be de-interleaved into two different .tif files. One .tif file for each color channel. See bAlignBatch for a Fiji plugin that does this.2. Make a new map  Fill in a new map name and choose the number of channels for each stack in your map.  Create a new map with ‘New Map’.  Append a stack from the Stack Browser with ‘Append Stack’.  Repeat # 3 for each stack.  Save the map with ‘Save Map’ button.Important  When you make a map, you need to choose the ‘Number Of Channels’ in each stack/session. Map Manager will only allow one choice of ‘Number Of Channels’ per map. You cannot mix one and two channel stacks within a map.  Make sure the scale of each imported stack is correct. It is hard to change the scale later. You can set the scale of a stack in its stack window with ‘shift+p’.  Make sure the sessions in your map are imported in the correct order. It is hard to change the order later.  As you import stacks from the stack browser there are some rules that must be followed. You will be prompted when you break these rules. In particular:          The stack scale must be set. Set the scale of a stack in a stack window with shift+p.      The stack must be loaded. Double click the stack in the stack browser to load a stack.      When importing 2 channel stacks, both channels must be loaded and you must select the first channel (ending in _ch1) in the stack browser.        New maps are saved to a default hard-drive folder. The default folder can be specified the Hard Drive Paths Panel. Right-click on a map name and select ‘Show On HDD’ to see the hard-drive folder where the map is saved.          On Windows, the default folder is ‘My Documents’.      On OSX, the default folder is ‘Documents’.      Congratulations, you just made a Map Manager map. The rest of this tutorial covers specifying and fitting segment backbone lines, adding spines, and connecting spines across timepoints.3. Create a line segment in each session/stack of the map and fit its backbone in FijiLine segments are first specified with control points and then fit using a custom FIJI plugin. Before fitting a line in FIJI, you need to install  the Bob_Neurite_Tracer_v3 plugin in FIJI and you need to specify the path to your FIJI application in the Hard Drive Paths Panel.See Fitting Segment In Fiji for help on FIJI versions, installing the plugin and specifying the FIJI application path in Map Manager.  Double-click the first session in your map (in the main Map Manager panel) to open a stack window.  Create a line segment by follow the instruction in annotating a stack.          Turn on Segment Editing with the checkbox next to ‘Line Segments’. You can also turn this on using ‘Edit Segments’ in the main Map Manager Panel.      Click the ‘+’ button to create a new (empty) segment.      Create Control Points along a segment with shift+click. Remember, all points are in 3D, make sure the points are in the correct imaging plane.      You can delete control points with the ‘delete’ key.      You can move control points with either the ‘m’ key or right-click menu ‘Move’.      Once control points are made, fit the backbone line in Fiji. Right-click on your segment in the list and select ‘Make from control points - Fiji’.        Repeat steps # 1 and # 2 for each session in your map. Making the same line segment in each session. As you make control points, be sure they are in the same direction along the segment for each session. For some help with the ordering of your control points, open the ‘stack db options’ panel and turn ‘Control Point Help’ ‘On’.  Set a pivot point in each line segment. Do this by clicking a point in the segment, right-click and select the ‘Set As Segment Pivot’ menu. The pivot point should refer to the same region of the segment across all session. A good strategy is to choose a region of the segment near an obvious spine that is present in all sessions. Another strategy is to choose a pivot point where some other segment (dendrite) crosses near your segment as these tend to remain stable across time. Try and put the pivot point near the center of the segment, do not place it at either end. The pivot point is used to calculate a line distance along the segment (in um) which in turn will be used to auto-guess connections between spines across sessions.Tip. When specifying control points and setting segment pivots, you can open multiple stack windows at the same time. Just double-click on each session in the main Map Manager Panel. This way, you can see the line segments you are making in each session of your map.4. Connect your line segments together  Close all stack windows using the Close Windows button in the main Map Manager panel.  Open a new stack run by right-clicking a session in your map and selecting the ‘Plot Run +- All’ menu.  Turn on the ‘Edit Segments’ checkbox in the main Map Manager panel. It is in the lower left of the panel.  Sequentialy connect your line segment from one timepoint to the next          Select the source timepoint segment (for example, timepoint 1). Make sure you select a point on the segment backbone line.      Select the destination timepoint segment (for example, timepoint 2). Again, make sure you select a point on the segment backbone line.      In the destination timepoint window (e.g. timepoint 2), press keyboard ‘p’ for Persistent (or use right-click menu).      Tip. You can see how your segments are connected by plotting a &#39;Segment Map&#39; from the main Map Manager panel. In the segment map window, right-click a segent and select &#39;Plot Run&#39; to plot a run of segments.5. Mark spines in each timepoint  Make sure ‘Edit Segments’ is off.  Open a single timepoint by double clicking a session in the list.  Follow annotating a stack to mark spines along your new segment.Tip. As you are working, keep your eye on the Igor command window. Each action you perform in Map Manager should report a few lines of text here. If this starts to spit out 1000&#39;s of lines there is probably a problem.6. Connecting stack db objects from one timepoint to the nextYou have two choices here.6.1 Use the Find Points Panel to connect objectsUse the Find Points Panel to browse spines in two timepoints. Find Points will also guess for the best connections and allow you to set them manually.6.2. Auto connect all objects using the map plot  Open a ‘Spine Map’ from the main Map Manager Panel.  In the spine map, select a spine in the first timepoint, right click and select ‘Connect Objects To Next’. This will make automatic connections of all spines from the first session to the next session.  Repeat this process for each pairwise session in your stack. You can also right-click and select ‘Connect All Objects’ to connect spines/objects through the entire map.  When working on spines, spines are connected if they are within a minimum distance of each other on their respective segment line. See ‘Connect spines within this distance (um)’ in the stack db options panel to set this option.7. Check the auto spine connections and edit as necessaryThis is the core of Map Manager and you will spend most of your time doing this. You need to verify the auto connections of each spine and you need to do this between each timepoint in your map. If your map has 4 timepoints, you need to verify the auto spine connections between timepoint 1-2, timepoint 2-3, and timepoint 3-4.  Open a run plot of three sequential timepoints by right-clicking a spine in the spine map and selecting ‘plot run +- 1’.  In the run plot windows, select a spine in the middle timepoint with ctrl+click. This will bring up the spine and its associated connections in all windows of the spine run. If there is no spine in a given timepoint, the image will be snapped to where the spine ‘would-be’.  From the middle timepoint spine selection, go to the next spine along the segment using keyboard ctrl+right. Go to the previous spine along the segment using keyboard ctrol+left.  Correct any errors in the spine dynamics using keyboard ‘a’ for addition, ‘s’ for subtraction, and ‘p’ for persistence. See run plot for details.8. Review your work by using search to query all additions and subtractions  Open the search panel from the main Map Manager panel with the ‘Search’ button.  In the search panel, make sure ‘map’ is slected and search for all spine additions with the ‘Additions’ button.  All added spines will appear as a list in the search results.  Right-click on a spine and select ‘plot run +- 1’ to bring up a spine run. [HERE I NEED TO CHANGE THE INTERFACE. I NEED A QUICKER WAY OF BRINING UP A SPINE RUN!!!]THIS IS WHERE I AM ENDING FOR NOW ON July 29, 2015 … THIS NEEDS TO BE EXPANDEDDO NOT READ BELOW HERE !!!![ADVANCED]: Importing a bSpine mapImporting bSpine maps is tricky. The problem is if your original maps for one time-series (_d1, _d2, etc.) have different sessions. For example, _d1 has sessions from dates 1,2,3 but _d2 has sessions from dates 1,2,6,12 there will be an error.Thus, there are two cases:      Your maps _d1, _d2 etc. all have the same exact sessions This is simple, use ‘Batch import bSpine map’. You will be prompted for the first map (you should select _d1). Once this is done, you need to hit all the buttons in ‘(2) fix’ to complete the import and then ‘save map’ in the main Map Manager panel.        Your maps _d1, _d2 etc. have different sessions.This DOES NOT WORK.  This documentation is not done#### Import group      Import One bSpine map. … not done        Append One bSpine map. … not done  #### Fix group  ** I am sick of writing documentation.

      "content"	 : "Stacks are annotated with 3D objects and line segments. Taken together, these 3D objects and line segments make a stack database (stack db).This example shows a stack window and its stack db with three line segments and a number of 3D objects, spines in this case.Open the stack db interface from any stack window using keyboard ‘[’Creating 3D objectsChoose the type of object in the ‘New Object’ group and shift+click in the image to create the object.- Spine : A spine is always connected to a segment (its parent segment). You can only create a spine if you first select the segment that will be its parent.- Bouton : This also requires a parent- vBranch :- soma :- peri :- controlPnt : Points along a segment that are used to fit a line in FIJI. - other :The different names allow you to organize your annotations into different groups. These groups can then be searched, plotted and connect together in a map.Tip. All objects are 3D points. To create a new point with better precision, zoom in the stack window with keyboard &#39;+&#39;. The zoom will follow the mouse pointer. Zoom out again with keyboard &#39;-&#39; and return to the full view with keyboard &#39;enter&#39;.Selecting an object  Single-click on the object. Selected object will appear as yellow circles. PRess keyboard ‘esc’ to cancel a selection.Moving an object  Select the object (single click), right-click and select ‘Move’. Your next click will be the new 3D position of the object. You are given feedback in the bottom of the stack window. Press ‘esc’ to cancel a move.Deleting an object  Select the object (single click), right-click and select ‘Delete’.  Select the object (single-click) and hit the ‘del’ key.Creating line segmentsExisting line segments are listed in the ‘Line Segment’ group. Each line segment has a length (um), a number of objects (nObj), a radius (r), and a color (c).Line segments are created as follows:  Make sure ‘Edit Segments ‘ is turned on.      Create a new (empty) line segment  Click ‘+’ button in the ‘Line Segment’ group. This will create an empty line segment.    Make a series of 3D control point objects along your dendrite/axon          Select ‘New Object -&amp;gt; Other -&amp;gt; Control Point’      Shift-click in the image to create a control point.      Continue making control points along the desired line segment in the image.        Fit the line in FIJI and import the resulting line segment back into map manager          Right-click on the new line segment (in the top left list) and select ‘Make From Control Points - FIJI’. This will open the xxx plugin in FIJI, fit a line to your control points and open the fitted line segment in the map manager stack window.      Important: When making control points, they need to be in order along a segment. If you ‘double-back’ a control point on the segment, the line fit with dumbly follow this ordering of control points. For help on the ordering of your control points, open the ‘options’ panel and turn on ‘Control Point Help’ with the ‘On’ button. If it all gets confusing you can just delete all your control points and start over.Important: When making a map, you will be associating individual line segments  from one session to the next. For segments that you will connect together in a map, make sure your control points are in the same general direction along each segment. If your control points go left to right in session 1, they should also go left to right in session 2.Line segment radiusEach line segment has a fixed radius in um. Spines are connected to this radius.To change the radius, double-click the radius for a segment and enter a new number. The radius of each segment is displayed in the ‘r’ column.Setting the radius will reconnect all your spines to that new radius while preserving the spine connection point to the line.To set all the radii of a run of connected segments, right click on the segment in the list and select ‘Set run to same radius’.Line segment pivot pointsWhen in a map, line segments need a ‘pivot point’. Specify a pivot point for a segment by clicking a point in the segment, right-click and select the ‘Set As Segment Pivot’ menu.The pivot point should specify a region of the segment that is the same in all sessions. A good strategy is to choose a region of the segment near an obvious spine that is present in all sessions. Another strategy is to choose a pivot point where some other segment (dendrite) crosses near your segment as these tend to remain stable across time. Try and put the pivot point near the center of the segment, do not place it at either end. The pivot point is used to calculate a line distance along the segment (in um) which in turn will be used to auto-guess connections between objects (spines) across sessions.",

Select a folder on the left and the list on the right will show the individual stacks within that folder.Double click on a stack in the list on the right and it will open a stack window to view the actual stack.Loading stacksLoad ScanImage DirectoryLoad a folder of ScanImage .tif stack. The name of the folder will appear in the list on the left. Selecting this folder will populate the list of stacks imported. Double click on a stack (in the list on the right) to view the stack.Important. When importing ScanImage .tif files, the scale is not set by ScanImage. You need to calculate your x/y voxel size (in um per voxel) when you scan at 1x magnification with 1024 by 1024 pixels. You then set this value in &#39;2p um/pixel (1024@1x)&#39;. Map Manager will use this value to calculate each stacks x/y scale for arbitrary ScanImage zoom settings.Load Generic DirectoryLoad a folder of .tif stacks ignoring any .tif header information. This has some consequences:  The stack will not have a scale. You can set the scale in a stack window with keyboard shift+p.  If the source .tif stack are multi-channel stacks, Map Manager will blindly import them as one big stack (usually with channels interleaved from slice to slice). Please see bAlignBatch for a Fiji plugin to pre-process your .tif stacks into ch1/ch2 file pairs.  The stacks will not have a date. Thus, map plots with date/days/hours will not be possible.Drag and dropThe simplest way to load a stack is to drag and drop a .tif file onto the Igor program icon. Stacks opened in this way will appear in a special folder (in the list on the left) called ‘DragAndDrop’.Tip. The order of stacks can be sorted by selecting columns in the stack list. To sort by date, select &#39;Date&#39; in the columns header.

Open and initialize Map Manager  Open Map Manager in Igor Pro (double-click the Map Manager.ipf file).  Click in the Igor Pro command window to compile (the command window is titled ‘Untitled’).  Initialize Map Manager by selecting the main menu ‘MapManager - Stack Browser’.  This will open the Stack Browser window2. Load a stack  Either  Drag and drop a .tif stack onto the Stack Browser.  Or  Load a directory of .tif files using the ‘Load Generic Directory’ button.Once a stack is loaded in the Stack Browser, double-click on its entry to display the stack in a Stack window.You need to set the proper X/Y/Z stack scale, in um, with keyboard &#39;shift+p&#39;. This is a critical step in MapManager as many measurements are made using um.3. Add 3D annotationsEach stack can have a list of 3D annotations, we call this a stack database (stack db).  In a stack window, open the stack db toolbar with keyboard ‘[’.  Add a new 3D point with shift+click.  Delete a point by selecting the point (mouse left-click) and hitting keyboard ‘Delete’ or ‘Backspace’.  Each point can have a textual note, select the point and fill in a note in the field below the list of points.4. Save your work  Save a stack db using the ‘Save’ button.  Load a previously saved stack db with the ‘Load’ button.  Important: You are responsible for saving your stack db. Use the ‘Save’ button.DetailsStack scaleSet the X/Y/Z stack scale in the main stack window with keyboard ‘shift+p’.Please set the proper scale before you make any stack db points.If you create stack db points and later need to change the scale you need to come see Bob.Exporting dataIt is very easy to export the 3D coordinates of the points in a stack DB.      Option 1: In the stack db toolbar of the main stack window, click on the list of points and then press keyboard ‘e’. This will open a text table of all points in the stack db, you can copy and paste it into your favorite analysis program.        Option 2: When you save a stack db you are saving all the points in a single text file. The file can be found in a folder named ‘stackdb’ in the hard-drive folder of your original stack.  Stack DB toolbarThe stack db toolbar displays a list of line segments and a list of points. Open and close the stack db toolbar with keyboard ‘[’.See annotating a stack for more detialed information on making 3D points, line segments, and special objects like spines.Line SegmentsSelecting a line segment in the list will select the same line segment in the stack window and vica-vera.PointsSelecting a point in the list will select the point in the stack window and vica-versa.Search panelOpen the Search panel from the stack db toolbar using the ‘Search’ button.The search panel will search a stack db and return a list of points. Once generated, clicking on a point in the search results will display the point in the main stack window.Different types of searches are performed with buttons:  All : Generate a list of all stack db points.  Notes : Generate a list of stack db points with notes.  Close : Search for points that have other points that are close.Once a search is performed, the search panel will display a list of results. Each row in the list of results is a point in the stack db. Single-click on a point in the list and it will be selected in the main stack window.If you zoom the stack window (keyboard +) you can snap to different points while maintaining the zoom using the search panel ‘Snap’ checkbox.The search results are a static output report. Once a search is performed, if points in the main stack window are modified (add, delete, move) the search results will not be automatically updated. If the points are modified in the main stack window and you want to use the search results, regenerate the search.Options panelOpen the Stack DB Options Panel from the stack db toolbar using the ‘Options’ button.",

Cycle different window candies with keyboard ‘shift+c’.  Set the default window candy in Options.  Note: The grid will only display when window candy is set to ‘All’ (when the stack axis are visible).HistogramThe histogram window show a histogram of pixel intensity values for each image in a stack.  Open the histogram window with keyboard ‘h’.  The histogram window shows a pixel intensity histogram for one image.  Scroll through the image in a stack (mouse-wheel) and the histogram for each image will be show.Making Z-ProjectionsOpen a maximal Z-Projection with keyboard ‘shift+z’. This allows you to set the top and bottom slice that goes into the Z-Projection.Once the Z-Projection window is open, it behaves just like a stack window (with only one slice). For example, you can zoom with +/-, pan with arrow keys, open the contrast bar with keyboard ‘c’, view a histogram with keyboard ‘h’, and copy/paste the image to another program, etc., etc.Viewing a sliding z-projectionA sliding Z-Projection is a special stack where each image plane is replaced by a small maximal Z-Projection showing slices just above and below the image plane you are viewing.You can switch to a sliding Z-Projection just like you can switch channels. Switch to a sliding Z-Projection for channel 1 with keyboard ‘3’ and for channel 2 with keyboard ‘4’.Options for the sliding Z-Projection are set with ‘bStack - Stack Browser Options’. See the end of the page documenting Options.Navigation windowThe navigation window opens a new window with a maximal z-projection of the stack and shows the current zoomed view as a blue square.  Right click and select ‘Navigation Window’ menu. A navigation window will be opened and your current zoomed view of the stack will be shown as a blue square.  Zoom with +/- or pan with arrow keys and the blue-square tracks what you are looking at.  The navigation window is, by default, a maximal z-projection of the entire stack.Zoom windowRight click and select ‘Zoom Window’.Point infoThe Point Info window shows information about the currently selected object.
