      "title": "Map Pool",
      "content"	 : "A map pool will plot multiple maps in the same plot and generate pooled statistics across these maps. The maps that go into a pool are specified by their ‘map condition’. In a normal map plot, the X-axis is often session or days. In a pooled plot, the X-axis is defined by each sessions ‘session condition’.A powerful additional feature is that individual spine values can be grouped (by their average) across multiple sessions in a map.Recipe to create a map pool  Specify ‘map conditions’ and ‘session conditions’ by turning on the ‘Edit Conditions’ checkbox  in main time-series window.  Open the pool plot panel from the main time-series window, ‘Pool’ button.  In the pool plot panel, specify a list of ‘map conditions’ and ‘session conditions’. Make sure the lists use ‘;’ as a separator.  In the pool plot panel, select a Y and X statistic to go into the pool.  In the pool plot panel, press ‘Make Group Pool’ to open a database window and a group plot window window.Note: The wildcard * character can be used when specifying ‘session conditions’. For example, if a few session are control sessions and they are labelled ‘c1’, ‘c2’, ‘c3’, creating a pool using c*; will average all CONNECTED spines across sessions c1/c2/c3 into a single group named c*.Pool Plot Panel      The maps and sessions that go into a pool are defined by the specified ‘map conditions’ and ‘session conditions’. If these map and session conditions are kept the same, a number of group plots with different x/y stats can be created (with ‘make group pool’) and they will all share the same Pool Database Window.        Each of these group plots can be returned to by selecting a plot in the ‘Pool ID’ popup and pressing the ‘Plot’ button.        Note: Grouped plots visualize the Y-stat versus ‘session conditions’ groups. The X-stat is used later to make Grouped Session Plot(s).  Pool Database Window  Selecting a ‘Cond’, ‘Map’, or ‘Seg’ in the database window will select the corresponding object in all opened Group Plot Window and Grouped Session Plot windows.  Individual conditions, maps, and segments can be turned on and off using the checkboxes. When this is done, the object is removed from the group plot window and does not contribute to statistics generated by the ‘stat table’ button.  Each map condition gets a color.  The color is shown by coloring the text for the condition in the pool database window and coloring the markers in the group plot windowGroup Plot Window.  The x-axis is the session conditions that went into the pool, we call these groups.  The y-axis is the Y-stat that went into the pool.  The marker colors indicate different map conditions.  Important: If the group plot was made using the wildcard * for session conditions (something like c*;), the individual markers in this plot are the AVERAGE of all connected spines within this session group.  Transform the Y-axis with ‘Transform’ popup. Transformations like % are normalized to the session condition group specified in the ‘Norm’ popup.  Make grouped session plot(s) using the ‘Session Plot’ button. This is where the original X-stat is finally used.  The ‘Stat Table’ button will generate a Grouped Plot Stat Table. The stats will always be derived from what is currently displayed in the plot. If the Y-Axis has been transformed to %, the stat table will contain mean/sd/se/n for %.  The ‘Edit Plot Values’ button wil generate a table with all the raw values currently displayed in the group plot window.Grouped Session Plot  Create a grouped session plot using the ‘session plot’ button in the group plot window.  Selecting an object in the grouped session plot will select the corresponding object in the group plot window and vice versa.  Keyboard ‘e’ will open a table of values displayed in the grouped session plot.For example, this is a Grouped Session Plot of: Y: b* % a* versus X: b* Raw. As always, the marker colors are indicating the map conditions.Grouped Plot Stat TableThe grouped plot stat table shows statistics (mean/sd/se/n) for the values currently displayed in the Group Plot Window. The stats are fairly thourough and are broken  into three blocks, the first block is mean/sd/se/n for map condition, the second block is for session condition, and the third is per segment.",

      "content"	 : "This was started on March 7, 2017 and is NOT FINISHEDThis is an overview. Please see the main Plot Panel, Stack Plot, and Map Plot.Map Manager plots values for each 3D annotation. Plots can be made from a stack, a map, and a pool of maps. These plots are very powerful because they are linked to the raw data. If a plot point looks suspicious, one can always return to the raw image data. Finally, these plots are powerful as they are publication ready.Plotting from a single stackFor a single stack, open the Point List window. Use the ‘Plot’ button to make Y vs X plots for values from the stack. Each point plotted is for a single 3D object (e.g. a spine). Right click on column row in the table and select ‘Set X Stat’ or ‘Set Y Stat’ to use the values in the column for plotting.Plotting from a mapUse the ‘Plot’ tab in the main time-series window. There are default plots provided here including ‘Spine Length’ as well as intensity measures such as:  Spine Sum: sSum  Spine Background Sum: sbSum  Background Subtracted Spine Sum: bssSum  Dendrite Sum: dSum  Dendrite Background Sum: dbSum  Background Subtracted Dendrite Sum: bsdSumAdvanced plotting with the Plot PanelOpen the main plot panel from the main time-series window using the ‘Plot’ button.The general idea is to select a Y value from the list, a corresponding X value and make a plot. All plots will show the values for individual 3D annotations (one annotation per point in the plot). There are two types of plots  Spine Plot Map - To plot a Y value versus an X map value such as days or hours. Add example  Session Plot (Map) - To plot values from 2 different sessions/timepoints. Use this to see how objects change from one time-point to the next. Add examplePlotting a map poolA map pool will make one plot holding data from a number of maps. There are two types of map pools, just like there are two types of plots.  Time-series pool - Map Pool (Time-Series)  Session pool - Map Pool(Sessions)The interface to creating a map pool from a number of open maps is in the Plot Panel.Plot Window InterfaceOnce a plot is made from a stack or a map, Map Manager provides a unified interface.  To get back to the raw stack. Select a point, right-click and choose a menu option.          Plot Stack      Plot Spine      Plot Run +/- 1      Plot Run +/- All      Plot Run +/- n        For spines, show only spines on a single dendrite or all dendrites. Do this by setting ‘Map Segment ID’ and/or the ‘All Segments’ checkbox.  Generate tables of numbers and statistics. Use the ‘Stats’ button. These can easily be copied and pasted into other analysis software.  Click and drag to visually select subsets of objects. There are three different selections, turn each one on with the 1/2/3 radio buttons. Once created, the ‘Stats’ button will include the statistics for these manual selections in the output table.Group PlotsGroup plots allow you to plot the mean for a spine across a number of sessions.  Specify session conditions for a map in main time-series window.  Specify a list of conditions to plot in main plot panel ‘Session Conditions’. This is a semicolon separated list and accepts ‘’ as a wildcard. For example ‘a;b;c’  Plot the group plot with the ‘Group Plot’ button in the main plot panel",

      "content"	 : "Map Manager uses a range of algorithms at different stages of the analysisWithin a single timepointCalculating distance along a segment and segment lengthEach point in the 3D tracing of a segment is assigned a 3D distance from the start of the segment. For calculating the total segment length, used in segment reports, the Z values of the 3D line segment fit are first smoothed. For a segment running parallel to a single image plane, the actual Z-values of the fitted 3D line tend to jump up and down between adjacent imaging planes. This causes an accumulation of erronious length and the total length is thus an overestimate of the ‘real’ length. By smoothing the Z values of a segment (before segment length calculation) we reduce this additive error.Connecting a spine to its segmentSpines are automatically connected to their respective dendritic segments by finding the line with the brightest pixels between the spine head and its segment.Starting from the closest point on the segment tracing, a number of candidate lines are drawn between the spine head and the nearby dendritic segment and the line with the brightest intensity is chosen. There will sometimes be errors in this calculation, especially when there is curvature in the dendritic segment, resulting in the starting point being mis-identified. These are easy to fix by right-clicking a spine, selecting ‘manually connect’ and then clicking on the center dendritic line to specify it connection point.The number of lines to search is a parameter.Line Points To Search When Connecting Spine/BoutonSpine intensity analysisSee intensity analysis.In a time-seriesFinding corresponding pointsPivot points are used to identify corresponding regions between image stacks in a time-series. Pivot points are regular 3D annotations that must be manually positioned to correspond to a structure that is present in each stack of a time-series. Map Manager can then snap to corresponding regions of an image in multiple timepoints by snapping to the same 3D offset with respect to each image stacks 3D pivot point.Connect points within this distance (um)Finding corresponding spinesDistance away from segment pivot point is used.Connect spines within this distance (um)",

The file format has not changed but the options have. Please remake your options!New Features  No more limitation on length of file names when importing into stack browser  Plot run +/- now has option to set ‘row’ of run  Added ‘Div’ option to plot panel.  Added option to normalize all spines to a constant value  Segment density report now has segment position information {zMin, zMax, zMean, zMedian, xyAngle, tort}  Main map manager panel now remembers its position  Main map plot now remembers its position  Conrol click on ‘close all windows’ will now close tables  Jumping spinesJumping spines are specified just like other persistent spines. select spines in both time-points and hit keyboard ‘p’. When you make jumping spines, the source and destination spines are required to be subtraction and addition respectively.  Added jumping to map searchImprovements  Fast left/right mouse click should no longer be a problem.  User clicks during long operations like opening a run should no longer be a problem.  Updated coloring of spines in map plot. If there is no previous segment, spines are no longer marked as added (green). If there is no next segment, spines are no longer marked as subtracted (red). Same rules for transient (blue).  Map Plot. Snapping a marquee rectangle and right-click to make a selection now prints the mean/sd/se/n for both x and y axis.  Map Plot. Snapping a marquee rectangle and right-click to make a selection now works for +/- from mask.  Stats button in map plot will now report grand mean of all spine masks in plot (previously was only per segment).  All spine dynamics now plot following colors and size specified in table in options panel.  The size of masks in map plots now follow ‘pntSel’ in main map manager options panel.  Revamped example user file. tried to make it clear that this can be empty and that values specified will over-ride setting in main options panel.  Added ‘dynamics’ menu to right-click in map plot.  Added ‘Edit Line’ menu to right-click in main stack window ‘Line Segments’.Bug Fixes  Fixed export to text. If there is an error during export. ‘Clear User’ then ‘Analyze User Map’ and try export again.  Replotting a run while existing run is linked will continue to correctly link  Linked windows +/- zoom now works when some windows have left control bar and some do not20160126New Features  Opening a stack will now display a floating dialog while stack is loading (it is yellow)  Exposed interface to set defaults for intensity background candidates.  We can now set # rows, # cols, row mult, col mult, and a boolean to include other side of dendrite. When you include candidates on the other side of the dendrite, you are doubling the # of candidated. Due to this increased analysis, spine/second is dropping down to ~8 spines/second  Added ‘segment ends’ search to return spines close to the end of each segmentNew Interface  Added ‘debug on error’ checkbox to the Intensity Tab. This turns ‘debug on error’ (global igor option) on/off to run intensity analysis for a map or a stack. You want to run intensity analysis with this OFF  added ‘export map’ to right-click of map list in main map manager panel  revamped search panel with two tabs: map and manual  reworked obj info window interface      - removed ‘analyze run’      - on ‘analyze’ we will now open ch1/ch2 if neccessary  control click on ‘Unload Stacks’ in main mapmanager panel to unload ALL stack across ALL open maps  added (density report, dynamics report) right-click to map in main map manager panel  added (scale, date/time) checkboxes to main map manager panel. This hides columns so you can see LONG ‘original names’General Improvements  Fixed user interface for clicking to set a manual position for intensity background      - clicking off the image does nothing      - if click results in roi going off image, we revert to last good background roi      - removed help text from main window and now display in igor command window  Rewrote ‘clear’ intensity analysis to be much faster.  Moved default plot window to left (was off screen to right for richard)  Rewrote ‘dynamics report’ to include 3d segment length and density. Previously lengths were calculated from 2d projections, now they are true 3d lengths. New columns are: {totalLen3d, goodLen3d, totalDen3d, goodDen3d}Bug Fixes  setting the segment pivot point will be correctly saved. Previous versions (not all of them) were not doing this correctly.  Fixed bug where the backbone roi was ‘looping around’ to previous backbone segment. This was happening for spines at the beginning of a segment (not at the end). Now, spines at both the beginning and end of a segment get the correct backbone ROI.  fixed plot panel (ch1, ch2, dyn) checkboxes, they now generate full stat lists including ‘u’ stats  [BUG] stat lists are using tp=0 to generate stats, if they are missing ‘u’, you will not get ‘u’ in stat list  fixed bug where right-click below segment list (in left control panel of stack window) would sometime give an errorKnown Bugs  ‘Export map’ has a bug if size of int analysis is different between stacks in a map. This happens if int analysis fails half way through and user ‘u’ stats are added to some but not other stacks. Solution is to clear and then re analyze intensity for the offending stacks. Be careful, when you clear, you lose your manual setting (individual spine background position, spine width, etc).20160119 Update (sent to users on 20160115 / 20160118)This is the first MapManager version of intensity analysisNew Features  Complete rewrite of intensity analysis  Depending on the size of your stacks, intensity analysis should do ~15 spines/sec for large stacks and ~50 spines/sec for smaller stack. Loading stacks is the rate limiting factor.  Spine roi is drawn using the longest spine length in each run  Added intensity bad. Can be set for each spine. Spines marked ‘intensity bad’ can be toggled in all plots.  Each spine has errors and warnings if intensity analysis had problems. Search for ‘errors and warnings’ to decide what to do with the errors. Most of the time you will set ‘Intensity Bad’  Intensity Analysis Errors occur when          spine roi is off image      backbone roi had to be shortened (near end of dendrite)      background roi not found because all candidates are off image        Intensity analysis should be run with ‘Procedure - Debug On Error’ off  Added ‘Save Map As…’ to save an entire map under a new name.

    "find-points-panel": {
      "title": "Find Points",
      "content"	 : "The find points panel allows you to browse objects between two timepoints/sessions, will show you the best-guess for putative connections, and allow you to connect/disconnect objects across timepoints/sessions.To open the find points panel:  Right-click a spine in a map and selecting ‘Find Points’.  Right-click a session in the time-series panel and selecting ‘Find Points’.  Right-click a map in the time-series panel and selecting ‘Find Points’.Overview  The find points panel displays a list of all spines in the source timepoint (sIdx). In this example there are 21 spines in the source timepoint.  For each spines in the source timepoint, it shows if it is connected to the destination timepoint (dIdx). It will color the dIdx cell red if there is no connection.  Any remaining spines in the destination timepoint (spines not connected to the source timepoint) will be displayed at the bottom of the list. In this example there are 3 of these spines.  Each spine in the source timepoint will also have a best ‘Guess’ connection in the ‘Guess’ column. For spines, this is using your ‘Segment Pivot’ for the two segments listed in Find Points and will connect spines across timepoints/sessions that are within ‘Connect spines within this distance (um)’. See the Map Manager Options Panel to set this.Interface  From TP. Source timepoint/session (From TP)  To. Destination timepoint/session (To timepoint)  Object Type. Select the type of objects to display.  ShowBad. If checked, bad points will be included in the list. Bad points will always have their ‘Idx’ column in red.  Segment ID. Limit the list to one segment ID.  All Segments. Generate the list for all segments. If you are connecting spines, leave this off (unchecked).  Refresh. Will refresh the Find Points list. [as of Nov 2015, there may be some edits to the map that do not refresh the list automatically.]Column NamesClicking on any column name will sort the list by the values in that column. Column names starting with ‘s’ are for the source timepoint (from TP), column names starting with ‘d’ are for the destination timepoint (to TP).  Idx - The row index in the table (no relation to object index).  sIdx - Source object stack db index.  sz - Source object z-depth  sParent - Source object parent segment.  spDist - Source object distance from pivot.  Guess - Automatically generated best guess for connection. This uses each objects distance from pivot (spDist and dpDist) and returns objects within X um, where X is specified by ‘Connect spines within this distance (um)’.  dIdx - Destination object stack db index.  dz - Destination object z-depth  dpDist - Destination object distance from pivot.  Dist - When two points are connected (both sIdx and dIdx are filled in), this is the distance between the two points measured as the distance between their two pivot points (spDist and dpDist).Interaction  Bring up a map run by right-clicking a row and selecting ‘Plot Run’.  Select an object in the list and it will be propagated to all run and map plots.  Use the keyboard to scroll through the list. The selected point will flash in all open windows.  Use left/right arrows to flash the selected object again.Using the keyboard to connect and disconnect objectsFor a selected row  ‘shift + right-arrow’ to commit the ‘Guess’ to the destination (dIdx). This will connect the source and destination objects together, making them persistent.  ‘del’ key to remove the connection. This will remove persistence between the source and destination objects.  ‘ctrl + p’ to set the selected point at the global pivot. This is not used for spines.TipsWhen used with a spine run, find points is a reliable way to check the connections between all objects in two timepoints.All objects in the source timepoint are in the list, followed by any remaining objects in destination timepoint that were not connected to an object in the source timepoints.By sorting the list with the source distance from pivot (spDist), you can step through all spines in the source timepoint sequentially along the dendritic segment.By sorting the list with the destination distance from pivot (dpDist), you get a sequential list of all objects in the destination timepoint.Example usage of find points panel. Here, we have a run of sessions 1/2/3 (top row). We have positioned the Find Points panel below the stack for session 2. By selecting rows (spines) in Find Points we can browse all spines in session 2, visualize their connections to session 3, and finally edit their connections to session 3 (using the keyboard in Find Points Panel).",

Once in Igor Pro, click in the command window to compile Map Manager and activate the main menus. The command window is in the lower left of your screen and has the window title ‘Untitled’.  To score a single timepoint stack, select the main menu ‘MapManager - Stack Browser’ to open the Stack Browser panel. See Annotating a stack for more information.  To score a timeseries of stacks (a map), select the main menu ‘MapManager - Time Series’ to open the main time series panel. See Making A Map for more information.Closing/Quiting Map Manager  Quit Igor Pro by selecting the main menu ‘Igor Pro - Quit Igor Pro’.  When you quit Igor Pro, you will always be prompted with the following dialog.  Always answer No. All Map Manager analysis is saved using the ‘Save’ buttons from within the Map Manager interface.Map Manager Options  Global options are set in the Options Panel.  There is one set of options that will be reloaded the next time Map Manager is run.  Save the current options with the ‘Save’ button in the Options panel.",

      "content"	 : "LimitationsImporting      Map Manager is designed to import single color channel 3D .tif files. For other file types (e.g. .lsm) or for other cases like 2 color channel .tif files we have some FIJI plugins that should get you started.        To import 2 color channel .tif files, the files need to be split into 2 separate .tif files (with _ch1 and _ch2 in their names). See bAlignBatch, a FIJI plugin that does this for you.        Does not handle .tif stacks with multiple repeats per images plane. Map Manager will import these stacks fine but does not know about the repeats. You want to strip out repeats before importing into Map Manager.  File name rules  Map Manager will have problems if any of the following strings are in your source file names:  _ch1  _ch2  _zsVisualization  Will only display one channel at a time. For most purposes this is fine. You can quickly switch between the color channels and run intensity analysis on both channels independently. To visualize a merged or composite image, use FIJI.",

      "content"	 : "Algorithm and StrategyAll intensity analysis is performed by calculating statistics (Sum, Mean, standard-deviation, N) from the intensity values of pixels within a number of 3D regions-of-interest (ROI). Further analysis is then derived by performing algebra between these ROIs.Spine ROIA polygon surrounding a spine. Starts as a rectangle and then overlapping regions of the backbone/dendrite ROI is subtracted. Any remaining disjoint regions (on other side of backbone/dendrite) are then removed. The spine ROI is centered in the same image plane as the spine head. Three parameters specify spine ROI: width, extend head, and extend tail.Backbone/Dendrite ROIA polygon centered on the spine connection point and extending a fixed distance (um) up and down the backbone/dendrite line. The backbone/dendrite ROI is centered in the same image plane as the spine connection point. The distance to extend up and down the backbone/dendrite line is set with ‘+/- Segment (um)’Background ROIBoth the spine roi and the backbone/dendrite roi get their own background ROIs. The spine background ROI is the same size/shape as the spine ROI. Likewise, the backbone/dendrite background ROI is the same size/shape as the backbone/dendrite ROI. The position of these background ROIs is the position that gives the minimal intensity from a number of candidate positions (a 3x3 grid emanating from the spine head). All background ROIs (both spine and backbone/dendrite) are centered in the same image plane as the spine head.Please note, parameters controlling the grid of candidate background positions is not exposed to the user.Running Intensity AnalysisFor a stack, intensity analysis is run from a stack window using the ‘Analyze Intensity’ button. This button is in the left panel, open the left panel for a stack with keyboard ‘[’.For a map, intensity analysis is run from the main map manager panel using the ‘Intensity’ tab.ParametersGlobal intensity analysis parameters are set in the stack db options panel. These parameters are used for every spine in a map.Once intensity analysis has been run, the parameters of individual spines can be set using the ‘Object Info’ panel in a stack. Open the Object Info window in a stack with keyboard ‘i’.  Width (um). Width of spine ROI centered on the spine line.  Extend head (um). Distance to extend the spine ROI beyond its spine head.  Extend tail (um). Distance to extend the spine ROI beyond it connection point with the backbone/dendrite..  +/- Slices. The statistics (Sum, Mean, SD, N) of each spine, backbone, and background ROI is calculated after expanding the ROI up and down in Z-dimension.      +/- Segment (um). The distance (um) to extend the backbone/dendrite ROI up and down the backbone/dendrite line.    Background - Both Sides. Only available as a global options.  Background Rows. Only available as a global options.  Background Row Mult. Only available as a global options.  Background Columns. Only available as a global options.      Background Column Mult. Only available as a global options.    Scale Radius (um). Only available for individual spines using the Object Info Panel. When intensity analysis is run (for a map), each spine is assigned a radius (um) following the radius of the segment it is attached to. Once intensity analysis has been run, this radius can be set for individual spines in the Object Info panel.Intensity Analysis OutputThe following statistics are calculated and displayed in the X/Y statistics lists in the Plot Panel.A table of these statistics can be displayed for each stack in the stack db panel. To do this: (1) in a stack window, open the stack db panel with keyboard ‘[’, (2) click on the point list and (3) use keyboard ‘i’ for intensity.Please note, ‘u’ is for user. User stats are simple algebra on the core intensity analysis.Spine ROIsSum:spine sumsMean:spine meansSD:spine standard deviationsN:# pixels in spine roiSpine Background ROIsbSum:spine background sumsbMean:spine background meansbSD:spine background standard deviationsbN:# pixels in spine background roiBackbone/Dendrite ROIdSum:dendrite sumdMean:dendrite meandSD:dendrite standard deviationdN:# pixels in dendrite roiBackbone/Dendrite Background ROIdbSum:dendrite background sumdbMean:dendrite background meandbSD:dendrite background standard deviationdbN:# pixels in dendrite background roiBackground subtracted ROIsubssSum:background subtracted spine sumubssMean:background subtracted spine meanubsdSum:background subtracted dendrite sumubsdMean:background subtracted dendrite meanCross channel statsutssmoss:this spine sum minus other spine sum.

This edit mode also shows the candidate background positions.  Mouse-Click to set a new position.  ‘Enter’ to accept new position.  ‘r’ to reset spine position. A new position will automatically be chosen next time spine is analyzed.  ‘esc’ to cancel moveErrors and WarningsWhen the intensity analysis has a problem analyzing a spine, errors and warnings will be set for that spine. Most errors are due to an ROI going off the image or in problems with drawing a valid backbone ROI (near the end of a segment).There are two ways to browse errors and warning:  Use the ‘Errors &amp;amp; Warnings’ button in the search panel.  Examine the ‘Errors’ column in a stacks point list panelBe careful of spines that are very close to each other. As spine density increases, the spine ROI of a spine will start to overlap with the spine ROI of its neighbors.There are two ways to check for nearby (high density spines). These are slightly different measurements, the first is examining closeness of the spine head as a 3D point, the second is examining closeness by looking at the connection point along a segment.  Use the ‘Closeness’ button in the search panel too find spine heads that are close to other spine heads.  Use the ‘nnDist’ column in the point list panel to find spines that are connected to a segment close to other spines connection points.Errors and Warnings areError # 3 x spine ROI beyond imageError # 3.5 y spine ROI beyond imageError # 6 reducing spine with ImageSeedFillError # 9 extending backbone errorWarning # 5.1 prev cPntIntensity DirtyA spines intensity analysis becomes ‘dirty’ and needs to be re-run whenever the geometry of a spine changes or the geometry of its connected spines change.Intensity analysis can be run on just ‘dirty’ spines using the ‘Only Dirty’ checkbox in the Intensity Tab of the main map manager panel. Dirty spines can be browsed using ‘Int Dirty’ in the main search panel.A spines intensity analysis becomes dirty when:  A spine is moved  A spine is reconnected to the backbone  Its analysis parameters are changed (width, extend head, etc.)  Any of the other spines connected to it are changed  Its dynamics are changed (addition, subtraction, persistent)",

    "stack-annotations": {
      "title": "Stack Annotations",
      "content"	 : "3D Annotations are the core of Map Manager. They are easy to create, edit, and in a map to connect them between time-points. Annotations can be searched, plotted, and exported.Creating and Editing 3D annotationsCreating an annotationShift+click in the image to create a new annotation. Remember, all annotations are 3D. Take care in choosing the imaging plane where you create an object. For spines, the point should mark the membrane limit near the tip of the spine.Selecting an annotationSingle-click on an annotation to select it. The selected annotation is shown as a yellow circle. Only one annotation can be selected at a time. Keyboard esc will cancel the annotation selection.Moving an annotationSelect the annotation (single click), right-click and select ‘Move’. Your next click will be the new 3D position of the annotation. You are given feedback in the bottom of the stack window. Press keyboard esc to cancel a move.Deleting an annotationSelect the annotation (single click), right-click and select ‘Delete’. Alternatively, select the annotation (single-click) and hit the del key.Tip. All annotations are 3D points. When an annotation is created, the x/y position is specified by the position of the mouse cursor and the z position is the currently viewed image plane. To create a new point with better precision, zoom in the stack window with ctrl + mouse-wheel or keyboard &#39;+&#39;. As always, zooming will follow the mouse pointer.Tagging annotations with ‘bad’ and ‘user type’Each annotation can be marked with different tags. To see most of the tagging options, right-click a selected annotation and look at the contextual popup menu.      Tagging an annotation ‘bad’    All annotations tagged with ‘bad’ will not be included in the analysis performed in reports and their visibility can be toggled in all plots. In general, stacks should be over annotated and ‘bad’ should be used to remove an annotation from the analysis but not from the database of annotations. In this way, as data sets grow (and time passes) when you return to something that looks promising (but is not), it will already have a ‘bad’ annotation.        Tagging and annotation with a ‘user type’    Each annotation can be tagged with one user type, from user type 1 through user type 10. This is useful for organizing annotations into different groups. Annotation user type can  be searched, used to plot subsets of annotations, and used to create a mask of annotations to overlay over a plot. For example, long spines cold be taged with ‘user type 1’ and then reports can be generated that break down the dynamics of all versus ‘user type 1’ spines.  Exporting annotationsIt is very easy to export the 3D coordinates of annotations.      Open the left control bar with keyboard [, click on the list of annotations and then press keyboard e. This will open a text table of all annotations in the stack, you can copy and paste it into your favorite analysis program. See stack report for more information.        When you save a stack or a map, all the annotations in each stack is saved in a single text file. The file can be found in a folder named ‘stackdb’ in the hard-drive folder of your original stack. See File formats for more information.        We provide, Map Manager - Matlab, an easy to use Matlab class library that allows all Map Manager analysis to be extended using Matlab.  Creating and editing line segmentsLine segments are fit using a custom Fiji plugin from within Map Manager, there is no need to manually interact with Fiji. The path to Fiji does need to be set in the hard drive paths panel.All the line segments in a stack are listed in the ‘Line Segment’ group. Each line segment has a length (um), a number of objects (nObj), a radius (r), and a color (c).Creating line segments  Make sure ‘Segments’ edit checkbox is turned on. This is in the left control bar which can be opened with keyboard [.  Create a new (empty) line segment  Click the + button in the ‘Segment’ group.  Make a series of 3D control point annotations along a dendritic segment.          Shift-click in the image to create a control point.      Continue making control points along the dendritic segment.        Fit the line segment in FIJI          Right-click on the new line segment (in the top left list of segment) and select ‘Make From Control Points - FIJI’. This will open the ‘Bob Neurite Tracer’ plugin in FIJI, fit a line to your control points and open the fitted line segment in the map manager stack window.      Important: When making control points, they need to be in order along a segment. If you double-back a control point on the segment, the line fit with dumbly follow this ordering of control points. If it all gets confusing you can just delete all your control points and start over.Important: When making a map, you will be connecting (e.g. making persistent) individual line segments  from one timepoint to the next. For segments that you will connect together in a map, make sure your control points are in the same direction along each segment. If your control points go left to right in time-point 1, they should also go left to right in time-point 2.Line segment radiusEach line segment has a fixed radius in um. Spines are connected to this radius. To change the radius, double-click the radius for a segment and enter a new number. The radius of each segment is displayed in the ‘r’ column. Setting the radius will reconnect all your spines to that new radius while preserving the spine connection point to the line. To set all the radii of a run of connected segments, right click on the segment in the list and select ‘Set run to same radius’.Line segment pivot pointsWhen in a map, line segments need a ‘pivot point’. Specify a pivot point for a segment by clicking a point in the segment, right-click and select the ‘Set As Segment Pivot’ menu.The pivot point should mark a region of the segment that is visually similar and identifiable in all time-points. A good strategy is to choose a region of the segment near a large spine that is present in all time-points. Another strategy is to choose a pivot point where some other segment (dendrite) crosses near your segment as these tend to remain stable across time. Try and put the pivot point near the center of the segment, do not place it at either end. The pivot point is used to calculate a line distance along the segment (in um) which in turn will be used to auto-guess connections between objects (spines) across time-points.",

    "run-plot": {
      "title": "Run plot",
      "content"	 : "A run plot is a sequence of stack windows, one for each session in a timeseries. The purpose of a run plot is to visualize the dynamics between annotations. The image below shows a run plot of spines. Spine # 201 is selected in each of three stack windows corresponding to timepoints.Opening a run plotTo open a run plot of annotations, right-click on an annotation and select ‘Plot Run +- …’. This will work in all map plots and search results.All run plots will have the timepoint of the selected annotation as the center window. The different options (+- 1, +- All, +- n) lets you choose how many timepoints before and after the selected timepoint.There are three types of run plots:  Annotation Run. Connected (persistent) annotations are centered and zoomed across sessions in a timeseries. Open an annotation run plot by right-clicking an annotation in a map plot.  Stack Run. A run plot showing the sequence of stacks in a timeseries. Open a stack run plot by right-clicking a session in the main time series panel.  Segment Run. Connected (persistent) segments are selected across sessions in a timeseries. Open a segment run plot by right-clicking a segment in a segment plot. There is currently only one type of segment plot and it is opened using the ‘Segment Map’ button in the main time series panel. This is only for spine annotations that have segment tracings.Navigating a run plotEach stack window in a run plot behaves just like an individual stack window. For example, shift+click will create a new annotation. In addition, run plot stack windows have some added features.Aligning a run plot to a selected annotationControl+click on an annotation in one stack window of a run plot will select, center, and zoom that annotation in all stack windows of the run plot. If a stack at a given timepoint is missing the annotation (for example, the object was subtracted), the image will center and zoom to the region where the annotation ‘would be’.Linking all the stack windows in a run plotKeyboard-l (that is lower-case ‘l’ as in ‘link’) will visually link all stack windows in a run such that panning, zooming, or setting the slice in one window will propagate to all other stack windows in the run. Linking can be turned on and off again by pressing keyboard-l.Editing annotation dynamics in a run plotThe dynamics between annotations and segments can be edited in a run plot.  Keyboard a : The selected annotation becomes added.  Keyboard s : The selected annotation becomes subtraced  Keyboard p : The selected annotations become persistent. This requires a selection in the previous timepoint.  Keyboard b : The selected annotation is tagged as bad. Bad tags are only available for annotations, not for segments.Persistent is a special case. When two annotations are connected between two sequential timepoints/sessions we refer to them as ‘persistent’. To connect two annotations and make them persistent, both annotations need to be selected (in their respective timepoints) and the annotations in the latter timepoint needs to be marked persistent with keyboard p.Important: The keyboard commands a/s/p will default to editing the dynamics of annotations. To edit the dynamics between segments, turn on ‘Segments’ edit.All of these keyboard commands have corresponding right-click contextual menus. Select an annotation and right-click to open the contextual menu.Reading annotation labels in a run plotThe dynamics of each annotation is encoded in the color of its label, green for addition, red for subtraction, and yellow for persistent. Persistent annotations are connected between timepoints, we call this a run. Annotations that are in the same run will be labelled with the same number in each of the stack windows of a run plot. Added annotation get a new label number. This system is designed to quickly visualize the connectivity between annotations.Example run plot following a spine (yellow circle) through multiple timepoints in a map.Same run plot as above after zooming in. All stacks in a run plot can be synchronized with keyboard ‘l’ (as in Link) so that zooming, panning, and setting the slice in one stack window of the run will propagate to all other stack windows of that run.A segment run plot with the same segment selected in all timepoints. Note the difference in scale compared to the spine run examples. All scale bars are 5 um.",

    "making-a-map": {
      "title": "Making a map",
      "content"	 : "A map is a time-series of stacks. You create a map by appending stacks from the stack browser. Once a map is made it can be saved, re-opened, annotated, and browsed using the time-series panel.The time-series panel shows a list of open maps on the left. When a map is selected (het3b in this example), a list of sessions in the map are shown on the right (in this example there are 12 sessions).Pre-process your raw dataMap Manager will only import single channel .tif stacks. If your stacks have two or more color channels, they need to be de-interleaved into separate .tif files, one .tif file per color channel. We have Fiji plugins to do exactly this for Zeiss LSM/CZI, Prairie View, and ScanImage.  ScanImage, use bAlignBatch  Zeiss, use bFolder2MapManager  Prairie, use bPrairie2tifImportant. Map Manager will only work with Igor Pro 6. Please make sure you have Igor Pro 6 and download a trial version of Igor Pro 6.3 if necessary.1. Open and initialize Map Manager  Open Igor Pro with MapManager.ipf  Click on the empty command window to activate Map Manager and its menus  Open the stack browser window with menu ‘MapManager - Stack Browser’.  Open the time-series window with menu ‘MapManager - Time series’.2. Make a new mapIn the time-series window ‘Map Making’ tab  Enter a new map name.  Set the number of channels for each stack in your map  Create a new map with ‘New Map’.2.1 Appending stacks to your map  In the stack browser, double-click each channel in a stack to open the actual image data.  In the stack browser window, select the first color channel of the stack to append. The first color channel ends in ‘_ch1’. Expand the window so you can see the full name of each stack.  In the time-series panel ‘Map Making’ tab, press ‘Append Stack’ button.  Repeat for each stack you want in your map.As you append stacks to your map you need to close the image data (in the stack browser) from the previous stack you just appended. Once a stack is appeneded to your new map and before opening the next, close the stack windows and in the stack browser unload the stack with right-click ‘Unload Stack’. In the stack browser, stacks with loaded image data are indicated with an ‘X’ in the ‘D’ column. Once the image data is unloaded, the ‘X’ will be removed. You need to do this for each color channel (_ch1, _ch2, _ch3) in a stack.Important  Number of channels is important. When you make a map, you need to choose the ‘Number Of Channels’. Map Manager will only allow one choice of ‘Number Of Channels’ per map. You cannot mix stacks with different numbers of channels within a map.  Stack scale is important. Make sure the scale of each imported stack is correct. It is hard to change the scale later. If you use the provided Fiji plugins this should be taken care of. If necessary, set the scale of a stack in its stack window with shift+p.  The order of stacks is important. Make sure the timepoints in your map are imported in the correct order. It is hard to change the order later.  All color channels must be loaded. All color channels in a stack must be loaded before it can be appended to a map. Load each color channel for a stack be double clicking each color channel (_ch1, _ch2, _ch3) in the stack browser.  Conserving memory is important. Once you have appended a stack to a map you need to use the stack browser to unload the raw data for that stack. Close each stack window, then right-click each channel in the stack browser list and select ‘Unload Stack’.2.2 Save your mapSave the map with ‘Save Map’ button. New maps are saved to a default hard-drive folder specified in the Hard Drive Paths panel.2.3 Congratulations, you just made a Map Manager map.The rest of this workflow covers tracing dendritic segments, adding spines, and connecting spines across timepoints. Before you do any of this, play with the stacks in your map. From the time-series window, open a run of stacks by right-clicking on a session and selecting ‘Plot Run +- 1’.3. Create dendritic tracingsDendritic tracings are specified with control points and then fit using a custom Fiji plugin. Before fitting a line in Fiji, you need to specify the path to your Fiji application in the Hard Drive Paths panel.  Open a stack window. In the time-series panel, double-click the first session in your map.  Create a line segment. See instruction in stack annotations ‘Creating and editing line segments’.          Turn on the ‘Segment’ edit checkbox.      Click the ‘+’ button to create a new (empty) segment.      Create Control Points along a segment with shift+click. Remember, all points are in 3D, make sure the control points are in the center of the segment and in the correct imaging plane. Ctrl+mouse wheel to zoom, click+drag to pan.      Delete control points with right-click menu ‘Delete’.      Move control points with right-click menu ‘Move’.      Once control points are made, fit the backbone line in Fiji. Right-click on your segment in the list and select ‘Make from control points - Fiji’.        Repeat steps # 1 and # 2 for each session in your map. Making the same line segment in each session. As you make control points, be sure they are in the same direction along the segment for each session.  Set a pivot point in each line segment. Click a point in the segment, right-click and select ‘Set As Segment Pivot’ menu.Pivot Points. The pivot point in each segment should refer to the same region of the segment across all session. A good strategy is to choose a region of the segment near an obvious spine that is present in all sessions. Another strategy is to choose a pivot point where some other segment (dendrite) crosses near your segment as these tend to remain stable across time. Try and put the pivot point near the center of the segment, do not place it at either end. The pivot point is used to calculate a line distance along the segment (in um) which in turn will be used to auto-guess connections between spines across sessions.Tip. When specifying control points and setting segment pivots, you can open multiple stack windows at the same time. Just double-click on each session in the time-series panel. This way, you can see the line segments you are making in each session of your map.4. Connect your line segments together  Close all stack windows using the Close Windows button in the time-series panel.  Open a new stack run by right-clicking a session in your map and selecting the ‘Plot Run +- All’ menu.  Turn on the ‘Segments’ edit checkbox in the left control bar of a stack window. Open the left control bar with keyboard [.  Sequentialy connect your line segment from one timepoint to the next          Select the source timepoint segment (for example, timepoint 1). Make sure you select a point on the segment backbone line.      Select the destination timepoint segment (for example, timepoint 2). Again, make sure you select a point on the segment backbone line.      In the destination timepoint window (e.g. timepoint 2), press keyboard p for persistent (or use right-click menu ‘Dynamics - Make Object Persistent’).      Tip. You can see how your segments are connected by plotting a &#39;Segment Map&#39; from the time-series panel. In the segment map window, right-click a segent and select &#39;Plot Run&#39; to plot a run of segments.5. Mark spines in each timepoint  Open a single timepoint stack window by double clicking a session in the time-series window.  Make sure ‘Segments’ edit checkbox is off.  See stack annotations to mark spines along your new segment.          Select the segment to add a spine to by selecting it in the list of segments or single click a point along the tracing (in the image).      Create a spine with shift+click. The spine should be marked at the membrane limit of the spine head, somewhere near the tip of the spine. Remember, all points are in 3D, take care in creating the spine in the correct image plane.      Move a spine with right-click ‘Move’.      Delete a spine with right-click ‘Delete’ or keyboard delete.      All spines are automatically connected to the dendritic segment with a line. Edit the connection point with right-click ‘Manual Connect’.      Tip. Be very liberal in your scoring, mark anything you think might be a spine. All annotations can be flagged as &#39;bad&#39; using the right-click menu &#39;bad&#39;. Bad objects stay in the database but are **not** included in the final analysis. As your datasets grow, marking putative spines with an annotation and then as bad allows you to return to a given image stack and see you already decided **not** to include a putative spine in your analysis.6. Edit the dynamics of annotations between timepoints6.1 Editing annotation dynamics manually from a run plotOpening a run plot  Open an object map from the time-series panel ‘Object Map’ button  In the object map, right-click an annotation and select ‘Plot Run +` 1’.  In a stack window in the run, control+click an annotation to snap all stacks in the run to the same image position. This will also automatically select all annotations that are persistent with the one you control+clicked.  Once a spine is selected, use ctrl+left arrow and ctrl+right arrow to select the next spine along the tracing. As you do this, the other stack windows in the run will snap to the same image position and automatically select spines that have been marked as persistent.Editing dynamics in a run plot  Mark an annotation as addition. Select the annotation and press keyboard a.  Mark an annotation as subtraction. Select the annotation and press keyboard s.  Mark two annotations as persistent. Select the annotation in the source timepoint, then select the desired annotation in the destination timepoint. In the destination timepoint, press keyboard p.As you edit the dynamics between annotations, all connections are automatically maintained. For example, marking an annotation as addition will automatically disconnect it from any previous annotation it was marked as persistent with.Before you make any edits to an annotation, it is both added and subtracted by default (e.g. transient). Annotations in the first timepoint can never be marked as added. Likewise, annotations in the final timepoint can never be marked as subtraction.6.2 Editing annotation dynamics with Find PointsWARNING: As of 20171023, the interface to find point is a bit brokenThe dynamics of annotations can be edited using the Find Points panel. This is done pair-wise between timepoints. For example, if your map has 4 sessions, you will use Find Points first between session 1 and 2, then between sessions 2 and 3, and finally between sessions 3 and 4.The Find Points panel will generate an automatic guess for the best connections and allow you to set them manually. This automatic guess is using the pivot point in your dendritic segment, if this pivot point does not correspond to a similar region of the segment between timepoints, the guess will be incorrect.  Close all stack windows with ‘Close Windows’ button in time-series panel.  Open the Find Points Pane by right-clicking the first session in your map and selecting ‘Find Points’.  In the Find Points panel, you are given a list of all annotations in the source timepoint. Click on a spine in the list and Find Points will open both the source and destination timepoints, zoomed onto that spine.This is the core of Map Manager and you will spend most of your time doing this.7. Curating your connected objects7.1 Review your work by using search to query all addition, subtraction and transient  Open the search panel from the time-series panel with the ‘Search’ button.  Search for added annotations with the ‘Addition’ button. The ‘Addition’ button is in the ‘Map’ tab.  All added annotations will appear as a list in the search results.  Right-click on an annotation and select ‘plot run +- 1’ to bring up a spine run.  Visually check that you agree the annotation is an addition and edit if necessary. Once you are in a run plot, you can always add and delete annotations, and edit the dynamics manually.  Do the same by searching for ‘Subtraction’ and then ‘Transient’7.2 Browse the connections visually and edit as necessaryThis is a repeat of what we already described aboveYou need to verify the connectivity of annotations between all timepoints in the map. If your map has 4 timepoints, you need to verify the annotation connections between timepoint 1-2, timepoint 2-3, and timepoint 3-4.  Open a run plot of three sequential timepoints by right-clicking a spine in the object map and selecting ‘plot run +- 1’. Open an object map with the ‘Object Map’ button in the time-series panel.  In the run plot windows, select an annotation in the middle timepoint with ctrl+click. This will snap and zoom the annotations and its associated connections in all windows of the run plot. If there is no annotation in a given timepoint, the image will be snapped to where the annotation ‘would-be’. This is using segment pivot points, if they are not specified or poorly marked, this snapping will not work.  From the middle timepoint spine selection, go to the next spine along the segment using keyboard ctrl+right arrow. Go to the previous spine along the segment using keyboard ctrl+left arrow.  Correct any errors in the spine dynamics using keyboard a for addition, s for subtraction, and p for persistence. See run plot for details.There are many many more features  See reports for details on generating reports of spine density and dynamics.  See intensity for details on spine intensity analysis.",

Once loaded, the following should be filled in for each stack  The stack scale can be automatically set for all imported stacks using the um/pixel x/y and z fields. This assumes all stacks in a folder have the same scale. The scale of individual stacks can then be set in the [stack][stack] window using keyboard shit+p.  If the source .tif stack are multi-channel stacks, see bAlignBatch for a Fiji plugin to pre-process .tif stacks into ch1/ch2 file pairs.ScanImage ImportThe Load ScanImage Folder loads a folder of ScanImage .tif stacks.Important. When importing ScanImage .tif files, the scale is not set by ScanImage. You need to calculate your x/y voxel size (in um per voxel) when you scan at 1x magnification with 1024 by 1024 pixels. You then set this value in &#39;2p um/pixel (1024@1x)&#39;. Map Manager will use this value to calculate each stacks x/y scale for arbitrary ScanImage zoom settings.Drag and dropThe simplest way to load a single stack is to drag and drop a .tif file onto the Igor program icon. Stacks opened in this way will appear in a special folder (in the list on the left) called ‘DragAndDrop’.Tip. The order of stacks can be sorted by selecting columns in the stack list. To sort by date, select &#39;Date&#39; in the columns header. This ordering is critical when batch importing a list of stacks into a Map Manager map.Browsing loaded data  Select a loaded folder on the left and the stacks in that folder will be shown on the right.  Double click a stack in the list on the right to open a stack window.Right-click a folder in the folder listRight-click a folder to open a contextual menu.      Unload Folder. Unload the folder and all its stacks.        Stack Report (all stacks).        Segment Report (all stacks). Generate a segment report for all stacks.        View Database (all stacks). Generate a table with all analysis. This can be copied and pasted into other programs for analysis.        Intensity Analysis (all stacks). Analyze the intensity of all stacks in the folder. It is critical that each spine in the analysis is checked manually. Please see [Intensity Analysis][intensity].        Save (all stacks). Will save the annotations for all ‘dirty’ stacks in a folder. Dirty stacks are stacks that have been changed or modified since they were loaded. Dirty stacks are noted in the stack list with a red background in the ‘D’ column.        Show Folder On Disk. Open the hard-drive folder the folder was originally loaded from. This opens a Finder window on OSX and an Explorer window on Microsoft Windows.        Refresh List. To refresh the list of folders and the selected folder’s list of stacks. This is generally not needed.  Right-click a stack in the stack listRight-click a stack to open a contextual menu. These menu items can also be triggered using the indicated keyboard shortcuts.      Display Stack. Open a [stack][stack] window. Same as double-click.        Unload Stack. Unload the raw data for a stack. Important, this unloads the raw data to conserve memory, it DOES NOT unload the stack annotations.        Stack Report.        Segment Report. Generate a segment report for all segments in a stack. See reports.        View Database. Open a text table with all annotations in the stack. This can be copied and pasted into other programs for analysis.        Experimental - Segment Length Plot. Make both 2D and 3D plots of segment length as a function of the Z-Smoothing parameter.

      "content"	 : "This describes a workflow for annotating 3D annotations in a single stack. To annotate a timeseries of stacks, please see making a map.1. Open and initialize Map Manager  Open Map Manager in Igor Pro (double-click the MapManager.ipf file).  Click in the Igor Pro command window to compile (the command window is titled ‘Untitled’).  Open the Stack Browser window by selecting the main menu ‘MapManager - Stack Browser’.2. Load a stack  Either  Load a folder of .tif files using the ‘Load Tiff Folder’ button.  Or  Drag and drop a single .tif stack onto the Igor Pro program icon.3. Display a stackOnce a stack is loaded in the Stack Browser, double-click on its name in the list to display the stack in a stack window.4. Add 3D annotations  In a stack window, open the annotation toolbar with keyboard [.  Add a new 3D annotation with shift+click.  Delete an annotation by selecting the point (single left-click) and hitting keyboard delete or backspace.  Each annotation can have a textual note, select the annotation and press keyboard n to enter a note. Notes can then be searched using the search panel.  See stack annotations for more information.5. Save your work  Save stack annotations using the ‘Save Stack’ button.  Important: You are responsible for saving your annotations. Use the ‘Save Stack’ button.Important conceptsStack scalePlease set the proper X/Y/Z scale before making any annotations. Set the X/Y/Z stack scale in the stack window with keyboard shift+p.Once 3D annotations are created, the scale can not be changed.You need to set the proper X/Y/Z stack scale, in um, with keyboard &#39;shift+p&#39;. This is a critical step in Map Manager as many measurements are made using um. Once annotations are reated the scale can not be changed.Searching annotationsOpen the Search panel from the main menus ‘Map Manager - Search’.The search panel will search all annotations in a stack and return a list of annotations. Once generated, clicking on an annotation in the search results will display the annotation in the stack window.Different types of searches are performed with buttons:  All : Generate a list of all annotations in a stack.  Notes : Generate a list of all annotations with notes.  Close : Search for annotations that have other annotations within a 3D distance.If you zoom the stack window (ctrl+mouse wheel or keyboard +) you can snap to different points while maintaining the zoom using the search panel ‘Snap’ checkbox.The search results are a static output report. Once a search is performed, if annotations in the stack window are modified (added, deleted, moved, etc.) the search results will not be automatically updated. If the annotations are modified in the stack window, simply regnerate the search results by perform the search again.",

      "content"	 : "A stack window displays a 3D image stack, one image plane (slice) at a time.NavigatingScrollingMouse-wheel to scroll up and down through images.PanningClick and drag will pan the image. Keyboard arrow-keys will also pan.ZoomingCtrl+mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Keyboard +/- will also zoom in and out. All zooming is done by following the mouse pointer. Keyboard Enter will return image to full zoom.Selecting annotationsSingle mouse click will select an annotation. Selected annotations are highlighted in yellow. Keyboard n to edit the selected annotation note. Right-click will show context menu for selected annotation.Canceling annotation selectionKeyboard esc will cancel all selections.Image contrastThe contrast bar is used to set image contrast in a stack window. Image contrast is critical, if contrast is not set properly you may not see dim but otherwise important structures in your images. Setting the contrast does not modify the image, it is purely for display purposes.  Open the contrast bar with keyboard c or use the right-click menu  Pixel intensity values below ‘min’ will be displayed as black  Pixel intensity values above ‘max’ will be displayed as whiteHistogramThe histogram window show a histogram of pixel intensity values for each image in a stack.  Open the histogram window with keyboard h or use the right-click menu.  The histogram window shows a pixel intensity histogram for one image.  Scroll through the image in a stack (mouse-wheel) and the histogram for each image will be show.Multiple color channelsUse keyboard 1, 2, and 3 to switch between channels one, two, and three. Channels can also be selected using the right-click menu.Raw   Your browser does not support the HTML5 video elementSliding Z-Project   Your browser does not support the HTML5 video elementSliding z-projectionA sliding Z-Projection is a special stack where each image plane is replaced by a small maximal Z-Projection showing slices just above and below the image plane you are viewing.You can switch to a sliding Z-Projection just like you can switch channels. Switch to a sliding Z-Projection for channel 1 with keyboard ‘3’ and for channel 2 with keyboard ‘4’. You can also use the right-click menu to switch to the sliding z-projection view.Switch to the sliding z-projection with shift+3 or shift+4 to set the number of slices in each projection in the sliding z-projection.Tip. The keyboard keys used to switch to a sliding z-projection change depending on the number of color channels. For stacks with one color channel, they become &#39;2&#39;.For stacks with two color channels, they become &#39;3&#39; and &#39;4&#39;.For stacks with three color channels, they become &#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, and &#39;6&#39;.Maximal Z-ProjectionsOpen a maximal Z-Projection with keyboard z or use the right-click menu. This allows you to set the top and bottom slice that goes into the Z-Projection.Once the Z-Projection window is open, it behaves just like a stack window (with only one slice). For example, you can zoom with +/-, pan with arrow keys, open the contrast bar with keyboard c, view a histogram with keyboard h, and copy/paste the image to another program, etc., etc.Scale barEach stack will display a white scale bar in µm. Control the length of the scale bar in Options.Window Candy  There are five different window decorations or candy options: (i) all, (ii) none, (iii) scale, (iv) scale + scroll, and (v) something else.  Cycle different window candies with keyboard shift+c.  Set the default window candy in Options.  Note: The grid will only display when window candy is set to ‘All’ (when the stack axis are visible).Navigation windowThe navigation window opens a new window with a maximal z-projection of the stack and shows the current zoomed view as a blue square.  Right click and select ‘Navigation Window’ menu. A navigation window will be opened and your current zoomed view of the stack will be shown as a blue square.  Zoom with +/- or pan with arrow keys and the blue-square tracks what you are looking at.  The navigation window is, by default, a maximal z-projection of the entire stack.Zoom windowRight click and select ‘Zoom Window’. The zoom window will follow the mouse pointer and show a zoomed in region of the current image.Right clickRight-click on the image and you will get a contextual menu to activate the features described on this page.Copy/Paste image into other programsIgor Pro is very good at copying images to the clipboard so they can be pasted into other programs. From a stack window, copying will copy the image with all the annotations, it does not copy the contrast (top) and scoring (left) toolbars. Annotations can be hidden with t.Voxel sizeThe x/y/z voxel size of each stack is set with keyboard shift+p. Setting the correct voxel size in µm is critical as MapManager performs many calculations in µm (NOT IN PIXELS). The voxel size must be set before annotations are created. Once annotations are created, you should not change the voxel size.Keyboard commandsMap Manager makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts. Use the right click menu to see the mapping between the function and the key. Here is a list of keyboard shortcuts. In a stack window, use keyboard shift+h to print this table.
