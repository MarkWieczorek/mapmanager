###Concepts

####Stack
Each segment within a stack has a number of spines and a total traced dendritic length. From this we can calculate spine density.

- Number of spines
- Dendrite length
- Spine density : number of spines / dendrite length

####Map
From one session to the next, the number of added and subtracted spines are counted. From this, the percent and density changes are calculated.

- # Added 
- # Subtracted
- % Added : # added / (number of spines in pervious session) * 100
- % Subtracted :
- Turn-over-ratio : A measure of total dynamics (both addition and subtraction)
- Density Added : 
- Density Subtracted :

####Svoboda style persistent and transient

Threshold time can be specified as: sessions, seconds, days, or hours.

- New Persistent : New spine that persists for > threshold time
- New Transient :
- Lost Persistent :
- Lost Transient :
- Always Present : Spines present in all sessions
