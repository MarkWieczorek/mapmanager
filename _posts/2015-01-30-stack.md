#### Overview
A stack window displays a 3D image stack, one image plane (slice) at a time.

- Use the mouse-wheel to scroll up and down through images, arrow keys to pan, +/- to zoom. Zooming with keyboard +/- follows the mouse pointer.
- Image contrast is critical, open the contrast control bar with keyboard 'c' and adjust min/max contrast with sliders. If contrast is not set properly you will not see objects in your image that are actually there.
- View a pixel intensity histogram with keyboard 'h'.
- Right-click a stack for a contextual menu for most of the features described below.
- Closing a stack window does not remove it from memory (the stack remains open).

#### Annotating a stack

Make new 3D points with shift+click. **All points are 3D**, the z position of a point will be the current viewed image when the 3D point is created. See [annotating a stack][3] for details on creating and editing 3D points and lines. To easily manage a stack db, open the left stack db panel with keyboard '['. 

#### Voxel size
<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/voxel-size-panel.png" WIDTH="300">

The x/y/z voxel size of each stack is set with keyboard 'shift+p'. **Setting the correct voxel size in &micro;m is critical** as MapManager performs many calculations in &micro;m (NOT IN PIXELS). The voxel size must be set before annotations are created. Once annotations are created, you should not change the voxel size.

#### Scale bar
Each stack will display a white scale bar in &micro;m. Control the length of the scale bar in [Options][2]. 

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

#### Viewing multiple channels

Use keyboard '1' and '2' to switch between channels. Channels can also be selected using the right-click menu.


#### Contrast bar
<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/contrast-bar.png" WIDTH="300">

The contrast bar is used to set the contrast of the images displayed in a stack window.

- Open the contrast bar with keyboard 'c' or use the right-click menu
- Pixel intensity values below 'min' will be displayed as black
- Pixel intensity values above 'max' will be displayed as white


<div class="print-page-break"></div>

#### Histogram

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/imagingcore/histogram.jpg" WIDTH="300">

The histogram window show a histogram of pixel intensity values for each image in a stack.

- Open the histogram window with keyboard 'h' or use the right-click menu.
- The histogram window shows a pixel intensity histogram for one image.
- Scroll through the image in a stack (mouse-wheel) and the histogram for each image will be show.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

#### Window Candy
 - There are five different window decorations or **c**andy options: (i) all, (ii) none, (iii) scale, (iv) scale + scroll, and (v) something else.
 - Cycle different window **c**andies with keyboard 'shift+c'.
 - Set the default window **c**andy in [Options][2]. 
 - Note: The grid will only display when window **c**andy is set to 'All' (when the stack axis are visible).

#### Making Z-Projections

Open a maximal Z-Projection with keyboard 'z' or use the right-click menu. This allows you to set the top and bottom slice that goes into the Z-Projection.

Once the Z-Projection window is open, it behaves just like a stack window (with only one slice). For example, you can zoom with +/-, pan with arrow keys, open the contrast bar with keyboard 'c', view a histogram with keyboard 'h', and copy/paste the image to another program, etc., etc.

#### Viewing a sliding z-projection

A sliding Z-Projection is a special stack where each image plane is replaced by a small maximal Z-Projection showing slices just above and below the image plane you are viewing.

You can switch to a sliding Z-Projection just like you can switch channels. Switch to a sliding Z-Projection for channel 1 with keyboard '3' and for channel 2 with keyboard '4'. You can also use the right-click menu to switch to the sliding z-projection view.

Switch to the sliding z-projection with shift+3 or shift+4 to set the number of slices in each projection in the sliding z-projection.

#### Navigation window

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/imagingcore/stack_navigation.jpg" WIDTH="300">

The navigation window opens a new window with a maximal z-projection of the stack and shows the current zoomed view as a blue square.

- Right click and select 'Navigation Window' menu. A navigation window will be opened and your current zoomed view of the stack will be shown as a blue square.
- Zoom with +/- or pan with arrow keys and the blue-square tracks what you are looking at.
- The navigation window is, by default, a maximal z-projection of the entire stack.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

#### Zoom window

Right click and select 'Zoom Window'. The zoom window will follow the mouse pointer and show a zoomed in region of the current image.


#### Point info

<img class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-point-info.png" WIDTH="300">

The Point Info window shows information about the currently selected object.  

- Open the Point Info window from any stack window using keyboard 'i'.  
- Use the point info window to annotate objects with text notes.


<div class="print-page-break"></div>

#### Right click

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-stack-right-click.png" WIDTH="200">

Right-click on the image and you will get a contextual menu to activate the features described on this page.
<div class="print-page-break"></div>

#### Copy/Paste into other programs

Igor Pro is very good at copying image data to the clipboard so it can be pasted into other programs. From a stack window, copying will copy the image with all the annotations, it does not copy the contrast (top) and scoring (left) toolbars. The scoring can be hidden by double-clicking the image, selecting all the Traces and clicking the 'Hide Trace' checkbox.

#### Keyboard commands

Map Manager makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts. Use the right click menu to see the mapping between the function and the key. Here is a list of keyboard shortcuts. In a stack window, use keyboard 'shift+h' to print this table.
