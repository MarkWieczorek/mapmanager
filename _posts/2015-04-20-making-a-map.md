A map is a sequence of [stacks][2]. You create a map by appending stacks from the [stack browser][1]. Once a map is made it can be saved, opened/loaded, annotated, and browsed.

In the Map Manager 3 window, the list of open maps is on the left. When a map is selected, a list of sessions within the map is shown on the right.

Double-click a session to open a [stack][2] window and begin adding [3D annotations][4].

####Making a new map
 1. Create a new map with '<span style="color:green">New Map</span>'.
 2. Append a stack from the [Stack Browser][1] with 'Append Stack'.
 3. Repeat #2 for each stack.

####Important
 - When you make a new map with '<span style="color:green">New Map</span>', the map is saved to a default hard-drive folder. Right-click on a map name and select 'Show On HDD' to see the hard-drive folder where the map is saved. The default folder can be specified in a [user file][3] file.
   - On Windows, the default folder is 'My Documents'.
   - On OSX, the default folder is 'Documents'.
 - As you import stacks from the [stack browser][1] there are some rules that must be followed. You will be prompted when you break these rules.
   1. The stack scale must be set. Set the scale of a [stack][2] in a stack window with shift+p.
   2. The stack must be loaded. Double click the stack in the [stack browser][1] to load a stack.

####General usage

  Once a map is created and saved, the map maker 3 panel can be minimized with the disclosure triangle (at the top of the window near the help/? button).

  Online help is available with the '?' button.

  Right-click on a map name in the list for a contextual menu.
