All reports will open a table of text that can be copy/pasted into another program for further analysis.

There are three types of reports: [stack reports](#stackreports), [segment reports](#segmentreports), and [map reports](#mapreports).

### Stack Reports

#### Segments

- Keyboard 'e' In the 'Line Segments' section of the main stack db panel to display a summary of each segment.
- Keyboard 'E' In the 'Line Segments' section of the main stack db panel to display the entire line (all 3D points)

#### Stack DB

- Keyboard 'e' In the 'Points' section of the main stack db panel to display the stack db as a table.

#### Intensity Analysis

- Keyboard 'i' In the 'Points' section of the main stack db panel to display intensity analysis as a table.

<p class="tip"><B>Tip.</B> Use keyboard '[' in any stack window to open and close the stack db panel.</p>

### Segment Reports

#### Density Report

A density report display statistics for each segment in a stack. It displays the length of the segment, the density of spines, and the x/y/z position of the segment. A density report can be generated for individual [stacks][1] or a map. 

To generate a density report for each segment in a stack

 - In a [stack window][1], keyboard 'o' for **o**utput report.
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], select a stack in the list, keyboard 'o' for **o**utput report.

### Map Reports

#### Dynamics Report

 
A dynamics report is used for a [map][2]. For each session in a map, it will calculate the length of each segment (um), the density of spines, the number of added spines, the number of subtracted spines, etc., etc.
 
In any [map plot][2], right-click and select 'Dynamics Report'. If the map plot is displaying 'All Segment', a table for each segment will be opened. Otherwise, one table for the current 'Map Segment ID' will be opened.

|numSpines |Total number of spines, goodSpines + badSpines
|goodSpines |Total number of good spines
|badSpines |Total number of bad spines

|totalLen		|Total segment length (um)
|goodLen		|Segment length between most distal good spines.

### Details on Calculations

#### Stack
Each segment within a stack has a number of spines and a total traced dendritic length. From this we can calculate spine density.

- Number of spines
- Dendrite length
- Spine density : number of spines / dendrite length

#### Map
From one session to the next, the number of added and subtracted spines are counted. From this, the percent and density changes are calculated.

- Number Added 
- Number Subtracted
- % Added : # added / (number of spines in pervious session) * 100
- % Subtracted :
- Turn-over-ratio : A measure of total dynamics (both addition and subtraction)
- Density Added : 
- Density Subtracted : 

#### Map Lifetime
Observed 

- observed sessions
- observed seconds
- observed days
- observed hours

Lifetime

- sessions
- seconds
- days
- hours

Age

- sessions

#### Svoboda style persistent and transient

Threshold time can be specified as: sessions, seconds, days, or hours.

- New Persistent : New spine that persists for > threshold time
- New Transient :
- Lost Persistent :
- Lost Transient :
- Always Present : Spines present in all sessions
