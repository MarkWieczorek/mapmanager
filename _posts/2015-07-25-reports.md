All reports will open a table of text that can be copy/pasted into another program for further analysis.

There are three types of reports: [stack reports](#stackreports), [segment reports](#segmentreports), and [map reports](#mapreports).

### Stack Reports

Reports can be generated directly from each stack window.

<p class="tip"><B>Tip.</B> Use keyboard '[' in any stack window to open and close the left stack db panel.</p>

#### Line Segments

- Keyboard 'e' In the 'Line Segments' section of the main stack db panel to display a summary of each segment.
- Keyboard 'E' In the 'Line Segments' section of the main stack db panel to display the entire line (all 3D points)

#### Points (stack db)

- Keyboard 'e' In the 'Points' section of the main stack db panel to display the stack db as a table.
- Keyboard 'i' In the 'Points' section of the main stack db panel to display intensity analysis as a table.

### Segment Reports

#### Segment Report

A segment report display statistics for each segment in a stack. It displays the length of the segment, the number and density of spines, the x/y/z position of the segment, and the number of each user spine type (e.g. mushroom, stubby, etc.). A segment report can be generated for individual [stacks][1] or a map. 

To generate a segment report for each segment in a stack

 - In a [stack window][1], keyboard 'o' for **o**utput report.
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], select a stack in the list, keyboard 'o' for **o**utput report.
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], right click a stack in the list of stacks and select 'Segment Report'.
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], right click a folder in the list folders (on the left) and select 'Segment Report (All Stack)'.

The columns in a segment report are as follows

|Name      |Meaning
| :-------------- | :-------------
|numSpines	|Total number of spines = goodSpines + badSpines
|goodSpines	|Number of good spines.
|badSpines	|Number of bad spines.
|totalLen	|(2D) Total segment length (um)
|goodLen	|(2D) Segment length (um) from most distal good spines.
|totalDen	|(2D) Total density of all spines = numSpines / totalLen
|goodDen	|(2D) Density of good spines = goodSpines / goodLen
|totalLen3d	|(3D)
|goodLen3d	|(3D)
|totalDen3d	|(3D)
|goodDen3d	|(3D)

|nUnknown	|Number of spines with userType 'Unknown'

|nFilapodia	|Number of spines with userType 'Filapodia'
|nLong	|Number of spines with userType 'Long'
|nStubby	|Number of spines with userType 'Stubby'

### Map Reports

#### Dynamics Report

 
A dynamics report is used for a [map][2]. For each session in a map, it will calculate the length of each segment (um), the density of spines, the number of added spines, the number of subtracted spines, etc., etc.
 
In any [map plot][2], right-click and select 'Dynamics Report'. If the map plot is displaying 'All Segment', a table for each segment will be opened. Otherwise, one table for the current 'Map Segment ID' will be opened.
  
|Name      |Meaning
| :-------------- | :-------------
|numSpines |Total number of spines, goodSpines + badSpines
|goodSpines |Total number of good spines
|badSpines |Total number of bad spines
| |
|totalLen		|Total segment length (um)
|goodLen		|Segment length between most distal good spines.
||
|totalDen		|Total density = numSpines / totalLen
|goodDen		|Density of good spines = goodSpines / goodLen
||
|nAdd			|Number of added spines.
|nSub			|Number of subtracted spines (at the current session)
|nSub2			|Number of subtracted spines (from the previous session)
|tor			|Turn-over-ratio = 
||
|pAdd			|Percent added = nAdd / goodSpines from previous session * 100
|pSub			|Percent subtracted = 
|dAdd			|Density added =
|dSub			|Density subtracted = 
||
|np			|New persistent = 
|nt			|New transient = 
|lp			|Lost persistent = 
|lt			|Lost transient =

### Details on Calculations

#### Stack
Each segment within a stack has a number of spines and a total traced dendritic length. From this we can calculate spine density.

- Number of spines
- Dendrite length
- Spine density : number of spines / dendrite length

#### Map
From one session to the next, the number of added and subtracted spines are counted. From this, the percent and density changes are calculated.

- Number Added 
- Number Subtracted
- % Added : # added / (number of spines in pervious session) * 100
- % Subtracted :
- Turn-over-ratio : A measure of total dynamics (both addition and subtraction)
- Density Added : 
- Density Subtracted : 

#### Map Lifetime
Observed 

- observed sessions
- observed seconds
- observed days
- observed hours

Lifetime

- sessions
- seconds
- days
- hours

Age

#### Svoboda style persistent and transient

Threshold time can be specified as: sessions, seconds, days, or hours.

- New Persistent : New spine that persists for > threshold time
- New Transient :
- Lost Persistent :
- Lost Transient :
- Always Present : Spines present in all sessions
