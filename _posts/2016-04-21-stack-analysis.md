Each stack tracing can be viewed as a table of text. With these tables it is easy to copy and paste into another program.

This includes separate tables for segments, stack db, and intensity analysis.

See [Map report][1] to generate density and dynamics reports for an entire map.

#### Segments

- Keyboard 'e' In the 'Line Segments' section of the main stack db panel to display a summary of each segment.
- Keyboard 'E' In the 'Line Segments' section of the main stack db panel to display the entire line (all 3D points)

#### Stack DB

- Keyboard 'e' In the 'Points' section of the main stack db panel to display the stack db as a table.

#### Intensity Analysis

- Keyboard 'i' In the 'Points' section of the main stack db panel to display intensity analysis as a table.
